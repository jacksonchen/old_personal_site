<div id="recenttitle">Inauguration of the Colorado Scholastic Team Chess Championship</div>
<div id="recenttext">14 teams with total of 73 students from various regions of Colorado including Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and Brighton, competed in our first Colorado State Scholastic Team Chess Championship tournament at the beautiful Brighton Recreation Center on May 3rd, 2014. </div>
<div id="recenttext">This is a one-day, invitation only tournament. USCF and CSCA memberships are required. More information about the tournament is posted on the <a href="about.html" class="link">about</a> page.</div>
<div id="recenttext">The following teams participated in this tournament:</div>
<div id="recenttext"><ul><li><strong>High Schools:</strong> Fossil Ridge, Monarch, Regis Jesuit and Rangeview</li>
<li><strong>Middle Schools:</strong> Overland Trail, Goddard, Lafayette, Kinard, Challenge and Lesher</li>
<li><strong>Elementary Schools:</strong> Ridgeview, Trout, AIES and Peak to Peak</li>
</ul></div>
<div id="recenttext">This tournament became the first rated tournament for over 30 scholastic players. Some of them went to the Class Championships in Greeley a couple weeks after the state championship. Hopefully many of these newcomers become the new blood of Colorado chess and will start to participate in future local and state tournaments.</div>
