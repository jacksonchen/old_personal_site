<div class="subtext">Unless otherwise approved by the state scholastic director, the following qualifications must be met in order for teams to participate in the Colorado Scholastic Team Chess Championship:
<ol>
	<li>Each team will have 4 players ranked by strength. Any additional team members will count as alternates, and if both teams have alternates, then the teams can agree to allow the alternates to play and affect the result of the match. Two alternates are recommended at least. 4 players are all that is required to fill a team.</li>
	<li>Team players must be from the same school. Home schooled kids will be allowed to join a school team of their choice in their region that is in relative proximity to their residence. Homeschoolers must participate in the qualifier on the qualifying team to be eligible.</li>
